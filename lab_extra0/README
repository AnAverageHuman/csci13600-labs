Notes:
    There are 10 extended test cases, but the last one is currently broken.

    To generate extended test cases, run:
        $ ./gentests.sh

    And enable them in the test executable with:
        $ export CXXFLAGS=-DTEXTEND=9
        $ make

    or:
        $ CXXFLAGS=-DTEXTEND=9 make

    or:
        $ make CXXFLAGS=-DTEXTEND=9

To build:
    $ make -j4

To run:
    $ make run

To run tests:
    $ make -j4 runtests

Also supports the following commands:
    all         same as default, or main
    debug       should produce a debug build
    valgrind    should check for leaks
    gdb         should start gdb
    clean       removes build directory and executables
