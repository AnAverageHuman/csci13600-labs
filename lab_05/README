Notes:
    The prime number verifier is probabilistic, with higher values of KAY
    producing a higher likelihood of the number actually being prime.  As such,
    you might find that false positives occasionally fall through the cracks.
    Aggressive test cases are included to guard against this, and the value of
    KAY is relatively high by default.  To forcibly set the value of KAY, set
    CXXFLAGS=-DKAY=<val> as either an environment variable, or on the same line
    as the call to make, for instance:
        $ export CXXFLAGS=-DKAY=5
        $ make

    or:
        $ CXXFLAGS=-DKAY=5 make

    or:
        $ make CXXFLAGS=-DKAY=5

To build:
    $ make -j4

To run:
    $ make run

To run tests:
    $ make -j4 runtests

Also supports the following commands:
    all         same as default, or main
    debug       should produce a debug build
    valgrind    should check for leaks
    gdb         should start gdb
    clean       removes build directory and executables
